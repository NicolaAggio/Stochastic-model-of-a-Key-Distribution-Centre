# Stochastic-model-of-a-Key-Distribution-Centre

The project consists of applying stochastic modelling techniques to the KDC model that is obtained as a variation of the one presented in the article. More specifically, the work is organized as follows:

1. Short introduction containing an informal, but careful, explanation of the problem which we wish to model;
2. Identification of the components of interest and the
activities which they undertake either individually or in co-operation;
3. Description of these components behaviourally, explaining how they interact with each other;
4. High-level description of each component in the PEPA stochastic process algebra;
5. Specification of the entire system in the PEPA process algebra as the co-operation of the above
components;
6. Drawing of the derivation graph of the model (or part of it);
7. Definition of the infinitesimal generator matrix Q of the Markov process underlying the system;
8. Definition of the steady state probabilities, throughput and utilisation using theoretical formulas;
10. Encoding of the system with the PEPA Eclipse Plug-in and computation of some measures.
